# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Important Limitations

⚠️ **Vercel has significant limitations for this Flask application:**

1. **No Persistent File Storage**: Uploaded files and generated files are not persistent
2. **Function Timeout**: Serverless functions have a 10-second timeout (30 seconds max with Pro)
3. **Memory Limits**: Limited memory for processing large files
4. **No File System**: Temporary files are cleaned up after each request

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use a Different Platform (Recommended)

For a file-processing application like this, consider these alternatives:

- **Railway**: Better for Flask apps with file operations
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Supports persistent storage
- **Heroku**: Traditional hosting with file system access
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Full control over infrastructure

### Option 2: Modify for Vercel (Limited Functionality)

If you must use Vercel, the app needs significant modifications:

1. **Use external storage** (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
2. **Process files in memory** instead of saving to disk
3. **Implement async processing** for large files
4. **Use database** for storing results instead of files

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Keep the main app on a traditional server and use Vercel for:
- Static frontend
- API endpoints that don't require file processing
- User interface only

## Current Vercel Configuration

The current setup includes:

- `vercel.json`: Vercel configuration
- `api/index.py`: Entry point for Vercel
- `app_vercel.py`: Modified Flask app for Vercel

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** (already done)
2. **Connect to Vercel** (already done)
3. **Deploy** - Vercel will automatically deploy

## Expected Issues

- **404 errors**: Due to routing issues
- **File upload failures**: No persistent storage
- **Timeout errors**: Large file processing
- **Memory errors**: Large CSV/Excel files

## Recommended Action

**Switch to Railway or DigitalOcean App Platform** for better compatibility with file-processing applications.

## Railway Deployment (Recommended Alternative)

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Railway will automatically detect the Python app
4. Add environment variables if needed
5. Deploy - much better for Flask apps with file operations

## DigitalOcean App Platform (Alternative)

1. Go to [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps)
2. Create new app from GitHub
3. Configure build settings
4. Deploy with persistent storage support
