# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

## Why Railway Instead of Vercel?

Railway is **much better** for your Flask app because:

- ✅ **Full file system access** (unlike Vercel's serverless limitations)
- ✅ **No function timeouts** (Vercel has 10-second limits)
- ✅ **Persistent storage** for your CSV files and templates
- ✅ **Easy Python/Flask deployment**
- ✅ **Automatic GitHub integration**
- ✅ **Free tier available** ($5 credit monthly)
- ✅ **No build complexity** - just works!

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Go to Railway
1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Click **"New Project"**

### Step 2: Connect Your Repository
1. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
2. Choose your repository: `martinabrandsco/alibaba-product-update`
3. Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app

### Step 3: Configure Deployment
Railway will automatically:
- ✅ Detect Python
- ✅ Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- ✅ Use the `Procfile` for startup
- ✅ Set up environment variables

### Step 4: Deploy!
1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
3. Your app will be live at a Railway URL!

## 📁 Files Created for Railway

I've created these files to make Railway deployment seamless:

### `railway.json`
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python3 app.py",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### `Procfile`
```
web: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

### Updated `requirements.txt`
```
Flask==2.3.3
pandas==2.1.1
openpyxl==3.1.2
Werkzeug==2.3.7
gunicorn==21.2.0
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables (Optional)

Railway will automatically set:
- `PORT` - The port your app should listen on
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` - Set to "production"

You can add custom environment variables in Railway dashboard if needed.

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

Railway provides:
- **Real-time logs** in the dashboard
- **Metrics** (CPU, memory, requests)
- **Automatic restarts** if the app crashes
- **Health checks** on `/health` endpoint

## 💰 Pricing

- **Free tier**: $5 credit monthly (enough for small apps)
- **Pro**: $5/month for unlimited usage
- **Much cheaper** than Vercel for this type of app

## 🔄 Automatic Deployments

Once connected to GitHub:
- ✅ **Auto-deploy** on every push to main branch
- ✅ **Preview deployments** for pull requests
- ✅ **Rollback** to previous versions easily

## 🆚 Railway vs Vercel Comparison

| Feature | Railway | Vercel |
|---------|---------|--------|
| File System | ✅ Full access | ❌ Read-only |
| Function Timeout | ✅ No limit | ❌ 10 seconds |
| Python Support | ✅ Excellent | ⚠️ Limited |
| CSV/Excel Files | ✅ Perfect | ❌ Problematic |
| Pricing | ✅ $5/month | ❌ $20/month |
| Setup Complexity | ✅ Simple | ❌ Complex |

## 🎯 Expected Results

After deployment, your app will:
- ✅ **Load without 404 errors**
- ✅ **Handle file uploads** properly
- ✅ **Process CSV files** with full functionality
- ✅ **Generate Excel files** correctly
- ✅ **Download files** without issues
- ✅ **Use all your data files** (vlookup_analysis_results.csv, template, etc.)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway logs in the dashboard
2. Ensure all files are committed to GitHub
3. Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies

### If app doesn't start:
1. Check the `Procfile` syntax
2. Verify `app.py` has the correct Flask app name
3. Check Railway logs for Python errors

### If files aren't found:
1. Ensure all CSV files are in the repository
2. Check file paths in `app.py`
3. Verify file permissions

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, you'll have:
- **Full-featured Flask app** running in production
- **All your functionality** working perfectly
- **Professional deployment** with monitoring
- **Easy updates** via GitHub pushes

## 🔗 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway** (5 minutes)
2. **Test all functionality** (upload, process, download)
3. **Share your live URL** with users
4. **Enjoy your working app!** 🎉
