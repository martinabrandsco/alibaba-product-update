# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Status

I've created a **minimal version** that should definitely work on Vercel:

### What I Fixed:

1. **Removed all external dependencies** - No template files, no large CSV files
2. **Embedded HTML template** - Everything is in the Python code
3. **Minimal requirements** - Only Flask, pandas, openpyxl
4. **Simple test version** - Using `api/test_simple.py` first

### Files Created:

- `api/test_simple.py` - Basic Flask app (no dependencies)
- `api/index.py` - Full demo version with embedded HTML
- Simplified `vercel.json` configuration

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test Basic Deployment
The current version uses `api/test_simple.py` which should work:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Vercel to deploy
2. **Visit your Vercel URL** - should show JSON response
3. **Check `/health`** - should return health status

### Step 2: If Basic Version Works
Once the basic version works, I can switch to the full demo version.

## Common Vercel Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Function not found"
**Solution**: Check that `vercel.json` points to the correct file

### Issue 2: "Import error"
**Solution**: All imports are now minimal and standard

### Issue 3: "Build timeout"
**Solution**: Removed heavy dependencies

### Issue 4: "Template not found"
**Solution**: Using embedded HTML templates

## Manual Vercel Setup (If Auto-Deploy Fails)

If the automatic deployment still fails, try manual setup:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Create New Project**
3. **Import from GitHub**
4. **Select your repository**
5. **Configure manually**:
   - Framework Preset: `Other`
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Output Directory: Leave empty
   - Install Command: Leave empty

## Alternative: Use Railway Instead

If Vercel continues to have issues, Railway is much better for Flask apps:

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Railway auto-detects Python/Flask
4. Deploy with one click

## Current Configuration

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/test_simple.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "api/test_simple.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Expected Results

- ✅ **No 404 errors**
- ✅ **JSON response** on main page
- ✅ **Health endpoint** working
- ✅ **Basic Flask app** running

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current deployment** (wait 2-3 minutes)
2. **If it works**: Switch to full demo version
3. **If it fails**: Check Vercel logs for specific errors
4. **Alternative**: Deploy to Railway for better compatibility

## Debugging Commands

If you have Vercel CLI installed:
```bash
vercel logs
vercel --version
```

## Contact Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Try Railway as alternative
3. Use local development for full functionality
