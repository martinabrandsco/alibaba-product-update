# 🚀 Deploy Your App to Railway - Step by Step

## Why Railway is Perfect for Your App

Your Flask app has been **struggling with Vercel** because:
- ❌ Vercel is designed for static sites and serverless functions
- ❌ Your app needs file system access for CSV files

- ❌ No persistent storage for your data files

**Railway is perfect** because:
- ✅ **Full file system access** - your CSV files will work
- ✅ **No timeouts** - process large files without issues  
- ✅ **Persistent storage** - your data files stay available
- ✅ **Easy Python deployment** - just works out of the box
- ✅ **$5/month** - much cheaper than Vercel
